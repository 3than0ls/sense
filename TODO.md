topbar decision- keep it when in budget or not?
budget item dropdown things  (TRANSACTION AND BUSINESS)

ACCOUNT IS NOW UNDER BUDGEWT, NOT SEPERATE FROM.
add dollar sign in front of inputs that require dollar signs

Add temporary loading state to add transaction and assign money   <----------- FINISH THESE TWO
see add transaction for how it's done

no other options for dropdown

Remove delete property from schema

Add reconciliations in Account

FUTURE NON ESSENTIALS:
single generic DeleteForm component that also handles loading state before closing, then apply it to transaction deletion (cuz I didnt do that)
add date to add transaction using https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/date-picker
replace Dropdown with shadcn's more sophisticated combobox (see dropdown menu) https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/combobox
replace AccountTransaction's table with shadcn's Resizeable so column widths are draggable (https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/resizable). Perhaps some more advanced features to, including searching, filtering, and sorting
