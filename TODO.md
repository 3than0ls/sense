TODO list:
--- Backend ---
API routes (action) for creating (POST) Budget, BudgetCategory, BudgetItem, Account, Transaction
API routes (action) for editing (POST) Budget, BudgetCategory, BudgetItem, Account, Trnasaction
 - not sure how exactly this will work? should we just send PATCH/update? or do a full PUT/replacement? Tyler's choice
API routes (loader) for getting (GET) Budget, BudgetCategory, BudgetItem, Account, Transaction

--- Middle ---
OAuth account creation?

--- Frontend ---
Form for: (creating an item creates it with some default values which the user then edits, and the edit menu is ofc auto opened)
    - Create/Edit Budget
    - Create/Edit BudgetCategory
    - Create/Edit BudgetItem
    - Create/Edit Account
    - Create/Edit Transaction
Custom scrollbar
Text color change based on budget states (namely red on negative)

--- Misc. ---
A name for the projecte

NEXT: 
Sidebar (medium) (have to make design decisions)

Add reconciliations in Account (hard)  <--- NEXT 4.0

when money is fully spent, budget item expanded bar looks funny, + tip needs to be fixed when 0 left to spend; styling in general for BIExpandedBar is just off <--- NEXT!!!

prisma optimization by only fetching what's needed, and then also correct type annotations using Pick

FUTURE NON ESSENTIALS:
transaction to more than one item
single generic DeleteForm component that also handles loading state before closing, then apply it to transaction deletion (cuz I didnt do that)
add date to add transaction using https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/date-picker
replace Dropdown with shadcn's more sophisticated combobox (see dropdown menu) https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/combobox
replace AccountTransaction's table with shadcn's Resizeable so column widths are draggable (https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/resizable). Perhaps some more advanced features to, including searching, filtering, and sorting
optimistic UI; easily implemented for BudgetMenuForm on budget item's transaction
clip the modal scrollbar with rounded corners
