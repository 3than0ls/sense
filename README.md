# Sense

A personal budget web app inspired by [YNAB](ynab.com) to monitor personal spending.

## About

Sense is a personal budget app that allows you to create budgets and assign targets to budgeted items. You can then track and monitor inflow and outflow to budgeted items by creating transactions associated with an account that should reflect your real world account.

## Showcase

Here's a budget I've started to monitor my monthly school expenses:
